README

SVM+HOG
Contains the files pertaining to SVM+HOG algorithm

train_svm.py - run this file if you want to train your own svm detector
data/ - has the dataset (vehicles and non-vehicles - To be downloaded from link provided in downloadables)
predict_svm.py - run this if you want to predict bounding boxes for a video
utils.py - contains helper files to read in images, extract features, etc.
bbox.py - contains helper files for bounding box visualizations like drawing, nms, etc.
weights/ -contains the weight file

To train a model run:
python3 train.py data_directory

where data_directory is where the dataset is present(eg: data/). The dataset must be organized as vehicles and non-vehicles.

eg: python3 train_svm.py data/ 


To predict bounding boxes for a video run:
python3 predict_svm.py path_to_video path_to_weights

where path_to_video is the path to the video inclusive of the video name and path to weights is the path weights inclusive of weights file name

eg: python3 predict_svm.py project_video.mp4 weights/weights.p 



YOLO
Contains the files pertaining to YOLO algorithm

layer.py - contains helper files that constitute the building blocks of the yolo architecture.
model.py - contains the model class (small_yolo) and a function to  build the model.
weights/ - contains trained weights for the model (Please download from link provided in Downloadables files and place in weights folder)
predict_yolo.py - run this if you want to predict bounding boxes for a video

To predict bounding boxes for a video run:
python3 predict_yolo.py path_to_video path_to_weights

where path_to_video is the path to the video inclusive of the video name and path to weights is the path weights inclusive of weights file name

eg: python3 predict_yolo.py project_video.mp4 weights/YOLO_small.ckpt
